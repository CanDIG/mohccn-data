Synthetic test data for MOHCCN

## NOTE: ingest scripts are now part of [candigv2-ingest](https://github.com/CanDIG/candigv2-ingest).

This repo contains test data and mappings for a couple of synthetic datasets. Mappings can be used with the [clinical_ETL tool](https://github.com/CanDIG/clinical_ETL_code) to create ingestable mcodepackets for Katsu.
